## Publishing a new version
- Make sure you are on a  **clean working directory**: no staged files, no unstaged files
- Run `yarn version`, when prompted, insert the new version number. This command will build the library and commit the changes tagged with the version. Running `git log -1` afterwards should show a commit with the new version.
- Push the changes with `git push origin master --follow-tags`
